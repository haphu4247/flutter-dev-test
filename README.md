### Architecture Layers

Each feature contains its own layers:

**Feature Structure**:
- **Repository**: Single source of truth, handles caching and business logic
- **ViewModel**: Presentation logic and UI state management
- **Service**: Thin wrappers around API endpoints
- **View**: Widgets that render UI only

**Shared Components**:
- `services/`: Common API services
- `models/`: Shared data models
- `providers/`: UI state (theme, locale, network)
- `base/`: Infrastructure and utilities

See [ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md](ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Dependencies

- **go_router**: Declarative routing
- **provider**: State management
- **dio**: HTTP client
- **shared_preferences**: Local storage
- **connectivity_plus**: Network connectivity
- **pull_to_refresh**: Pull-to-refresh functionality
- **app_settings**: System settings access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Flutter Doctor Issues**: Run `flutter doctor` and fix any reported issues
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `flutter pub get`
3. **Localization**: If you see missing localization errors, run `flutter gen-l10n`
4. **Build Issues**: Try cleaning the project:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter gen-l10n
   ```

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Android
- Ensure Android SDK is properly installed
- Check that your device/emulator has developer options enabled
- For release builds, ensure you have a valid keystore

#### iOS
- Ensure Xcode is updated to the latest version
- Run `cd ios && pod install` if you encounter CocoaPods issues
